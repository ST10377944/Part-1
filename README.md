To compile and run the software(code), you must follow the steps that Iâ€™ll mention as follows:
1. Open any IDE.
Open Any IDE that supports or have the C# extension. Personally, I used Visual Studio so it might be a good idea and easier just to download the Visual Studio IDE.
2. Open Project with Folder.
You can also browse existing folders with the C# Visual Studio code as I will also attach the exact file with the code from Visual Studio, after browsing the file you will then select and open it through Visual.
Paste Your Code.
You can simply open a new project and then delete the startup code that will be provided, after you have opened a new project, you can then copy and paste the code and a renaming of project name will pop and then rename it to the given name.
NB: Your Choice.
3.Run the program.
After you have opened the project or have pasted it you can now Run the program by just pressing the Run button.

You can choose a choice that suits you well to compile and run the program between the opening a project and the Paste Your code method.
